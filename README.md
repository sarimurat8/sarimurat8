- Hello, I’m Murat Sari
- I’ve recently started to learn to use python, I'm looking to develop myself and keep record of my progress here.
- I'm interested in developing my skill set further and I'm interested in data analytics, statistics and related fields. I'm open to all suggestions which will help me further my career.
- I'm fluent in Turkish and English. I can speak a bit of Russian (although I'm very rusty) and I've recently started learning Dutch.
- I have a bachelor's and master's degree in Economics.


- You may find me on LinkedIn on this address: https://www.linkedin.com/in/murat-sari/
